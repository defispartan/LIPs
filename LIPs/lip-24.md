title: LIP-24 Lens Frame standard
description: Establish a protocol standard for developers to create interactive applications that integrate Lens authentication and functionality.
author: defispartan <defispartan.lens>
status: Draft
type: Protocol
created: 2024-04-08

## Abstract

This proposals introduces a [specification for Lens Frames](https://github.com/defispartan/lens-frames), and proposes that it is adopted as a standard for Lens developers. Lens frames are an implementation of Open Frames, a standard set of tags and procedures for developers to integrate Lens authentication and functionality into frames. The specification also proposes a new text publication metadata field: `preferredFrame`, to embed Lens publications and open actions as frames.

## Motivation

Frames are an extension of the [OpenGraph protocol](https://ogp.me/) that enable interactive elements to be embedded between web applications.

A frame is a session between a frontend and frame server. The frame server exposes visual elements and actions that are able to be interacted through a frontend that embeds the frame. Frames can represent a wide variety of applications including informational guides, games, Web3 transactions, image galleries, e-commerce, live data, and much more.

A frame session is also able to incorporate authentication protocols, allowing the frame server to verify the inputs and identity of a user. The [Open Frames standard](https://github.com/open-frames/standard/tree/main) is a set of standard frame tags that enables a frame to share visual elements and specify support between different authentication protocols.

The motivation for creating this proposal is so that applications and frame developers can agree upon a set of frame tags, features, and procedures to verify frame requests by Lens Profiles. This reduces fragmentation of features between Lens applications and enhances the capabilities of Lens creators to expose new types of frontends for their Lens publications and modules.

## Specification & Rationale

The Lens frame specification that is proposed to be adopted is here: https://github.com/defispartan/lens-frames.git

It is planned to be maintained at this location and updated according to semantic versioning. The full specification is also copied below.

# Overview

Frames are an extension of the [OpenGraph protocol](https://ogp.me/) that enable interactive elements to be embedded between web applications.

A frame is a session between a frontend and frame server. The frame server exposes visual elements and actions that are able to be interacted through a frontend that embeds the frame. Frames can represent a wide variety of applications including informational guides, games, Web3 transactions, image galleries, e-commerce, live data, and much more.

A frame session is also able to incorporate authentication protocols, allowing the frame server to verify the inputs and identity of a user. [Open Frames](https://github.com/open-frames/standard/tree/main) is a set of standard frame tags that enables visual elements of frames to be shared between protocols.

The Lens Frames specification is an implementation of Open Frames that defines a standard to create interactive applications that integrate Lens Protocol authentication and functionality.

The highlights of the Lens Frames specification are:

- Frame request types and authentication based on Lens primitives
- Implement tags and request types from Open Frames standard
- Lens API and Lens SDK methods to perform signing and verification of requests
- Publication metadata field to enable Lens publications as frames
- Interactions with open action modules
- Describe how open actions can be executed through transaction frames, and enhance the verifiability for apps

# Specification

A frame is a set of <meta> tags returned within the <head> of an HTML page.

If a page contains all required frame properties, apps will render the page as a frame. The frame <meta> tags extend the OpenGraph protocol.

A frame app begins with an initial frame which is cached by apps and shown to users. A frame must have an image. It may have buttons, which when clicked load other frames or redirect the user to external websites.

## Tags

A frame property is a meta tag with a property and a content value.

### Required Properties

In compliance with the Open Frames standard, use a meta tag in your frame's HTML to declare the client protocols your frame supports.

<meta property="of:accepts:lens" content="2024-03-01" />

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `of:version`      | The version label of the Open Frames spec. Currently the only supported version is `1.0.0`                                       |
| `of:accepts:lens` | The minimum client protocol version accepted for the given protocol identifier. Currently the only supported version is `1.0.0`. |

## Images

There are a few rules for serving images in `of:image` tags:

- The size of the image must be < 10 MB.
- The type of image must be jpg, png or gif.
- The image source must either be an external resource with content headers or a data URI.

Clients may resize larger images or crop those that do not fit in their aspect ratio. SVG images are not because they can contain scripts and extra work must be done by clients to sanitize them.

When a frame server receives a POST request:

- It must respond within 5 seconds.
- It must respond with a 200 OK and another frame, on a post button click.
- It must respond with a 302 OK and a Location header, on a post_redirect button click.
- Any Location header provided must contain a URL that starts with http:// or https://.

Frame servers can use cache headers to refresh images and offer more dynamic first frame experiences:

Frame servers can use the max-age directive in the HTTP Cache-Control header to ensure images in the initial frame refresh automatically. A lower max-age ensures images update regularly without user interactions. App developers should respect cache headers set by the original frame image, and their image proxy implementations should not interfere with durations.

It is recommended to add timestamps or UUIDs to image urls on subsequent frames to bust caches, and return a frame with a "refresh" button if it is expected that a frame response could take > 5 seconds.

## Button actions

### `post`

The `post` action sends a HTTP POST request to the frame or button `post_url`. This is the default button type.

The frame server receives a signed frame action payload in the POST body, which includes information about which button was clicked, text input, and the cast context. The frame server must respond with a `200 OK` and another frame.

## `post_redirect`

The `post_redirect` action sends an HTTP POST request to the frame or button `post_url`. You can use this action to redirect to a URL based on frame state or user input.

The frame server receives a signed frame action payload in the POST body. The frame server must respond with a `302 Found` and `Location` header that starts with `http://` or `https://`.

## `link`

The `link` action redirects the user to an external URL. You can use this action to redirect to a URL without sending a POST request to the frame server.

Clients do not make a request to the frame server for link actions. Instead, they redirect the user to the `target` URL.

## `mint`

The `mint` action allows the user to mint an NFT. Clients that support relaying or initiating onchain transactions may enhance the mint button by relaying a transaction or interacting with the user's wallet. Clients that do not fall back to linking to an external URL.

The target property must be a valid [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) address, plus an optional token ID appended with a `:`.

## `tx`

The `tx` action allows a frame to send a transaction request to the user's connected wallet. Unlike other action types, tx actions have multiple steps.

First, the client makes a POST request to the `target` URL to fetch data about the transaction. The frame server receives a signed frame action payload in the POST body, which includes the `profileId` and optional `signer` field that can be verified using the [authentication](#authentication) steps. The frame server must respond with a `200 OK` and a JSON response describing the transaction which satisfies the following type:

```ts
type TransactionTargetResponse {
  chainId: string;
  method: "eth_sendTransaction";
  params: EthSendTransactionParams;
}
```

### Ethereum Params

If the method is `eth_sendTransaction` and the chain is an Ethereum EVM chain, the param must be of type `EthSendTransactionParams`:

- `abi`: JSON ABI which **MUST** include encoded function type and **SHOULD** include potential error types. Can be empty.
- `to`: transaction recipient
- `value`: value to send with the transaction in wei (optional)
- `data`: transaction calldata (optional)

```ts
type EthSendTransactionParams {
  abi: Abi | [];
  to: `0x${string}`;
  value?: string;
  data?: `0x${string}`;
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "chainId": "eip155:1",                                // The chain ID of the transaction
  "method": "eth_sendTransaction",                      // The method to call on the wallet
  "params": {
    "abi": [...],                                       // JSON ABI of the function selector and any errors
    "to": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001", // The recipient of the transaction
    "data": "0x00",                                     // Transaction calldata
    "value": "123456789",                               // Value to send with the transaction
  },
};
```

The client then sends a transaction request to the user's connected wallet, or uses the calldata to generate a signed or dispatched action for Lens protocol actions following instructions [here](#lens-publications-as-frames--open-actions). The client should then send a POST request to the `post_url` with a signed frame action payload including the transaction hash in the `actioNResponse` field to which the frame server should respond with a `200 OK` and another frame.

## Frame Requests

When a user clicks a button on a frame, the frame receives a POST request with the payload format below. The payload contains `untrustedData`, containing details of the action taken, and `trustedData`, an EIP-712 signed message from a profile owner or delegated executor used to verify the authenticity of `untrustedData`.

```
{
  clientProtocol: "lens",               // string, authentication protocol that frame server will verify
  untrustedData: {
    profileId: "0x123",                 // string, Lens profile ID performing the action
    pubId: "0x123-0x1",                 // string, Lens publication ID being interacted with, poster profile ID + publication index
    url: "https://example.com",         // string, the URL of the Frame that was clicked. May be different from the URL that the data was posted to.
    unixTimestamp: 123456789,           // number, Unix timestamp in milliseconds
    buttonIndex: 1,                     // number, the button that was clicked
    inputText?: "Hello, World!",        // string, optional, input text for the Frame's text input, if present. Undefined if no text input field is present
    deadling?: 123456789,               // number, optional, unix timestamp of signature expiration
    state?: "%7B%22counter%22%3A1%7D"   // string, optional, state that was passed from the frame, passed back to the frame, serialized to a string. Max 4kB.q
    actionResponse?: "0x"               // string, optional, transaction hash, if executed through tx button
  },
  trustedData: {
    messageBytes: "",                   // string, EIP-712 signed message of request payload or blank string if action is not authenticated
    identityToken?: "",                 // string, optional, token issued by Lens API to verify profile identity and/or perform verification with Lens API from frame server
    signerType?: "",                    // string, optional, specifies type of signer used to sign typed data from messageBytes: "owner" or "delegatedExecutor"
    signer?: "",                        // string, optional, address used to sign type data from messageBytes
  }
}
```

## Authentication

When a frame server receives a [request](#frame-requests), the server is able to verify that the contents of `untrustedData` are authorized by the associated Lens `profileId` using the steps described here.

A Lens Profile is an NFT with one owner address and any number of delegated executors, addresses with the ability to execute actions on a profile's behalf. Lens frame authentication is based on verifying EIP-712 signed typed data from a profile owner or delegated executor.

<summary>Frame Request EIP-712 Typed Data</summary>

```
// EIP-712 domain
const domain = {
    name: 'Lens Frames',

    deadline: 123456789,
};
```

Any address that has signless interactions enabled has approved the Lens API as a delegated executor, this is recommended as the default form of authentication to enable frame interactions without manual signatures. The end-to-end process of authenticating a frame request is as follows:

1.) Lens application requests a frame signature from Lens API OR the currently connected address if profile does not have signless actions enabled on Lens API. Methods for constructing and signing typed data are detailed in [integration section](#integrate-lens-frames).

2.) Lens application sends POST [request](#frame-requests) to frame server with `trustedData` fields populated based on (1).

3.) Frame server verifies signature by constructing typed from frame request and validating that message is signed by profile owner or delegated executor. Methods for constructing and verifying typed data are detailed in [building section](#build-lens-frames).

# Build Lens Frames

A minimum viable frame consists of a web server serving tags from the [Lens specification](#tags). When a frame server receives a request to the `post_url` or `url` (depending on which is specificed), it can: perform authentication, perform background actions, update frame state.

A frame can authenticate the Lens profile id that originated a request, the address that signed the request (profile owner or delegated executor), and that the content of the request matches what the profile signed. It can do so utilizing the `trustedData` fields as described in [authentication](#authentication).

The following sections detail how frame servers can utilize various methods to authenticate a Frame request:

<details>
<summary>Lens Client SDK</summary>

NodeJS script to create and verify typed data from Lens Client SDK based on `untrustedData` and `trustedData` inputs from frame request. Install library with preferred package manager:

```
yarn install @lens-protocol/client@alpha
```

```
const { LensClient, production } = require("@lens-protocol/client");

const lensClientConfig = {
  environment: production,
};

const lensClient = new LensClient(lensClientConfig);

lensClient.frames
  .createFrameTypedData({
    ...req.body.untrustedData // Frame server request, untrustedData
  })
  .then((response) => {
    lensClient.frames
      .verifyFrameSignature({
        identityToken: req.body.trustedData.identityToken, // Frame server request, trustedData.identityToken
        signature: req.body.trustedData.messageBytes, // Frame server request, trustedData.messageBytes,
        signedTypedData: response,
      })
      .then((verification) => {
        if(verification === FrameVerifySignatureResult.Verified){
          console.log("Frame request verified")
        } else {

Authentication may be abstracted by utilizing a frame library that supports Lens frame authentication. Instructions will be linked here once support is added for popular libraries: frames.js (in progress), onchainkit, and frog.

# Integrate Lens Frames

A client Application is where Frames are rendered. A publication containing Frame tags has elements rendered based on the Frame specification and individual tags/values of the Frame instance.

When a user clicks a button on a frame, the app makes a POST request to the frame server. The server must respond with a new frame that is sent back to the user.

The Frame lifecycle begins when a user creates a publications containing a frame URL. The client application should:

- Check all embedded publication URLs for valid frames (based on meta tag versions).
- If the frame is valid, render the frame when the cast is viewed.
- If the frame is malformed, fall back to treating it as an OpenGraph embed.
- Follow the frame security model.
- Proxy image requests to prevent frame servers from tracking users.
- Sanitize redirect URLs to ensure they start with http:// or https://.
- Only accept data URIs if they are images.
- Avoid rendering SVGs as they may contain executable code.

### Rendering Frames

Apps may render frames any time they are showing a Lens Publication to a viewer. The following rules apply to the rendering of frames:

1. Buttons must be displayed in ascending index order below the image.
2. Buttons may be displayed in multiple rows if space is a constraint.
3. Text inputs must be displayed above the buttons and below the image.
4. Text input labels must be shown above or inside the text input.
5. Apps must respect the aspect ratio set in the `of:image:aspect_ratio` property.

If the button is a `post_redirect` or `link` action:

1. It must be visually marked with a redirect symbol.
2. Users should be warned when leaving the app for untrusted sites.

If the button is a `mint` action, the following rules also apply:

1. Must validate that a [CAIP-10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/main/CAIPs/caip-10.md) URL is present in the `target` property.
2. Must display the item as an NFT, if all the properties are valid.

If the button is a `tx` action, validation should be performed at the discretion of the app with recommendations described [here](#transaction--open-action)

### Handling Clicks

If the button clicked is a `post` or `post_redirect`, apps must:

1. Construct a [Lens Frame Request](#lens-frame-request).
2. POST the packet to `of:button:$idx:target` if present
3. POST the packet to `of:post_url` if target was not present.
4. POST the packet to or the frame's embed URL if neither target nor action were present.
5. Wait at least 5 seconds for a response from the frame server.

If the button clicked is a `mint`, apps should:

1. Allow the user to mint the NFT or open an external page that allows this functionality.
2. Must display the item as an NFT, if all the properties are valid.

If the button is a tx action:

Must visually indicate that a tx button will request a wallet transaction.
Must display the button label provided by the frame.

### Handling Responses

Applications will receive responses from frame servers after a POST request is submitted. The following rules apply to the handling of these responses:

1. If the button action was `post`, treat all non-200 responses as errors.
2. If the button action was `post_redirect`, treat all non-30X responses as errors.
3. If handling a 30X response, apps must redirect the user to the url location value.
4. If handling a 30X response, apps must ensure the url starts with `http://` or `https://`.
5. If handling a 30X response, warn the user before directing them to an untrusted site.

### Signing Frame Requests

A frame can authenticate the Lens profile id that originated a request, the address that signed the request (profile owner or delegated executor), and that the content of the request matches what the profile signed. It can do so utilizing the `trustedData` fields as described in [authentication](#authentication).

The following sections detail how frame servers can utilize various methods to authenticate a Frame request:

<details>
<summary>Lens Client SDK</summary>

The process for signing frame requests depends on whether the profile has Lens API signless interactions enabled. To check if signless is enabled:

<details>
<summary>Signless Enabled</summary>

NodeJs script using Lens Client SDK to query whether profile has Lens API signless interactions enabled.

```
const { LensClient, production } = require("@lens-protocol/client");

const lensClientConfig = {
  environment: production,
};

const lensClient = new LensClient(lensClientConfig);

lensClient.profile
  .fetch({ forProfileId: "0x2a6b" }) // insert profileId here
  .then((response) => console.log(response.signless));
```

</details>

If signless is enabled, then the Lens API can sign frame requests on behalf of a user. The SDK method documented below can be used to generated a frame request signature.

<details>
<summary>Sign Frame Request</summary>

NodeJs script using Lens Client SDK to generate frame request signature. Note: requires profile to be logged into API session, [login details](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/login).

```
const { LensClient, production } = require("@lens-protocol/client");

const lensClientConfig = {
  environment: production,
};

const lensClient = new LensClient(lensClientConfig);

// parameters populated based on frame request
lensClient.frames
  .signFrameAction({
    actionResponse:
      "0x4a2765ce77932feacfb2b06ee63161afe34781d6e00a6997af87cbe21d6b5b91",
    buttonIndex: 1,
    inputText: "Some input text",
    profileId: "0x2a6b",
    pubId: "0x2a6b-0x27-DA-0587635a",
    specVersion: "1.0.0",
    state: "Some state",
    url: "https://example.com",
  })
  .then((response) => console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2)));
```

</details>

If signless is not enabled for a profile then a frame request must be manually signed by the profile owner or a delegated manager. An application can either choose to disable frame interactions if this is the case, or generate and request that a user sign each frame using `signTypedData` wallet method. The following method can be used to generate typed to sign based on the frame request.

<details>
<summary>Create Typed Data</summary>

NodeJs script using Lens Client SDK to generate typed data to sign for frame request.

```
const { LensClient, production } = require("@lens-protocol/client");

const lensClientConfig = {
  environment: production,
};

const lensClient = new LensClient(lensClientConfig);

// parameters populated based on frame request
lensClient.frames
  .createFrameTypedData({
    actionResponse:
      "0x4a2765ce77932feacfb2b06ee63161afe34781d6e00a6997af87cbe21d6b5b91",
    buttonIndex: 1,
    deadline: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600,
    inputText: "Some input text",
    profileId: "0x2a6b",
    pubId: "0x2a6b-0x27-DA-0587635a",
    specVersion: "1.0.0",
    state: "Some state",
    url: "https://example.com",
  })
  .then((response) => console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2)));

```

### Transaction / Open Action

Applications should perform validation to ensure that users are not exposed to harmful actions, and display a detailed prompts (and potentially simulation) to inform users of the action being taken.

The recommended form of validation for Lens Applications is only allowing transactions that interact with Lens Protocol contracts, and if the action is a custom module such as an open action: verifying that the transaction originated from [within a Lens publication](#publications-as-frames--lens-protocol-actions), and the transaction data matches an open action address embedded in the publication.

An open action is a smart contract module embedded in a Lens publication. When a Lens application receives a transaction response, the app can check whether the destination address (and potentially parameters from initialize calldata as well) matches one of the open action modules attached to the publication. This is the recommended form of validating transactions because it is able to verify the intent of the user creating the publication, and also allows applications to maintain a list of recognized open action contract addresses that are able to be embedded.

Application can also validate using an allowlist of URLs for the transaction request, or a combination of open action and URL validation.

# Publications as Frames / Lens Protocol Actions

The LIP (Lens Improvement Proposal) to introduce Lens Frames also proposes to add a publication metadata field: `preferredFrame`. The field enables Lens publication to appear in a feed, and automatically have the modules it contains (reference modules and open actions) rendered as transaction frames within a Lens application feed.

The `preferredFrame` metadata field enables application developers to build a new open action, or a frontend for an existing action, and have it automatically embedded when a publication with the module appears in a Lens application feed.

The Lens API and SDK infrastructure provide methods to sponsor transactions of core protocol actions and modules that are [verified](https://github.com/lens-protocol/verified-modules). Lens applications can use this infrastructure to allow transaction frames to be executed as gasless or signless interactions. For now, the process of decoding transactions parameters and encoding them into methods for gasless/signless transactions within Lens infrastructure would need to be done manually using ABI returned with transaction. In the future, they may be helper methods to more easily convert a transaction frame response to a sponsored equivalent.
